# Amazon Apparel Recommendation: Real-Life case study on amazon apparel recommendation<br/>
This case study will focus on fetching similar items to a given product from amazon catalog. The similariy would be based on product image, product description and brand + color. <br/>
I will use text vectorizers (word vectors) to convert text information into feautes and CNN features to convert images into vectors <br/>
Based on these features we will try to find the product similarity using Euclidean Distance.<br/>
<b>Dataset</b>: I have used amazon's Product advertising API to get approximately 183,000 women's fashion products' information  that consists of Image-URL, Title, Price, Description etc.
